User can sign up
  - two main things are being stored in the database: username & hashedPassword
  - in the handleSubmit method within the class AuthForm class componenet, the server
    is handling a post request and is checking if the user clicked on sign up or sign
    in the fetch request
  - When the user signs up for an account, the data will be sent as a JSON of
    username & password to the database to be saved.
  - the user's data will be sent as an object
  - the hash routing will happen, if the action === is sign-up then it will change
    to the sign-in page
  - Depending on the page, it will show different click options




user can sign in
  - user can try signing in now, if the password does not match, it will return
    an error message to the user
  - Once the credentials are inputted, the server will use Argon2.verify will to make
    sure that the password is matched to the hashedPassword
  - handleSignIn() in app.jsx handles beign stayed signed in even if the page refreshes





user can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page)
- componentDidMount() has an event listener for the route and handleSignIn to allow user
  to stay in even if the page is refreshed
- the token will be stored in the localStorage
- as long as user is not null, then it will stay sign in

user can sign out
  - when a user signs out, it will use the handleSignOut(),
  it will reset the state of user to null
  - it will also remove the react-context-jwt
